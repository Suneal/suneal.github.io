Towards a Natural Perspective of Smart Homes for Practical Security and Safety Analyses, To appear in IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (S&amp;amp;P) 2020  [ arXiv preprint  ]  Abstract: Designing practical security systems for the smart home is challenging without the knowledge of realistic home usage. This paper describes the design and implementation of Helion, a framework that generates natural home automation scenarios by identifying the regularities in user-driven home automation sequences, which are in turn generated from routines created by end-users. Our key hypothesis is that smart home event sequences created by users exhibit inherent semantic patterns, or naturalness that can be modeled and used to generate valid and useful scenarios. To evaluate our approach, we first empirically demonstrate that this naturalness hypothesis holds, with a corpus of 30,518 home automation events, constructed from 273 routines collected from 40 users. We then demonstrate that the scenarios generated by Helion seem valid to end-users, through two studies with 16 external evaluators. We further demonstrate the usefulness of Helion’s scenarios by addressing the challenge of policy specification, and using Helion to generate 17 security safety policies with minimal effort. We distill 16 key findings from our results that demonstrate the strengths of our approach, surprising aspects of home automation, as well as challenges and opportunities in this rapidly growing domain."

In Proceedings of the 9th ACM Conference on Data and Application Security and Privacy (CODASPY). Dallas, TX, USA. [ PDF  ] Abstract: Home automation platforms provide a new level of convenience by enabling consumers to automate various aspects of physical objects in their homes. While the convenience is beneficial, security flaws in the platforms or integrated third-party products can have serious consequences for the integrity of a user’s physical environment. In this paper we perform a systematic security evaluation of two popular smart home platforms, Google’s Nest platform and Philips Hue, that implement home automation “routines” (i.e., trigger-action programs involving apps and devices) via manipulation of state variables in a centralized data store. Our semi-automated analysis examines, among other things, platform access control enforcement, the rigor of non-system enforcement procedures, and the potential for misuse of routines. This analysis results in ten key findings with serious security implications. For instance, we demonstrate the potential for the misuse of smart home routines in the Nest platform to perform a lateral privilege escalation, illustrate how Nest’s product review system is ineffective at preventing multiple stages of this attack that it examines, and demonstrate how emerging platforms may fail to provide even bare-minimum security by allowing apps to arbitrarily add/remove other apps from the user’s smart home. Our findings draw attention to the unique security challenges of platforms that execute routines via centralized data stores, and highlight the importance of enforcing security by design in emerging home automation platforms."
