<h3> Abstract: </h3>
<div style="text-align: justify">
Designing practical security systems for the smart home is challenging without the knowledge of realistic home usage. This paper describes the design and implementation of Helion, a framework that generates natural home automation scenarios by identifying the regularities in user-driven home automation sequences, which are in turn generated from routines created by end-users. Our key hypothesis is that smart home event sequences created by users exhibit inherent semantic patterns, or naturalness that can be modeled and used to generate valid and useful scenarios. To evaluate our approach, we first empirically demonstrate that this naturalness hypothesis holds, with a corpus of 30,518 home automation events, constructed from 273 routines collected from 40 users. We then demonstrate that the scenarios generated by Helion seem valid to end-users, through two studies with 16 external evaluators. We further demonstrate the usefulness of Helionâ€™s scenarios by addressing the challenge of policy specification, and using Helion to generate 17 security safety policies with minimal effort. We distill 16 key findings from our results that demonstrate the strengths of our approach, surprising aspects of home automation, as well as challenges and opportunities in this rapidly growing domain.

## Features

- Full-text search with [simple-jekyll-search](https://github.com/christian-fei/Simple-Jekyll-Search)
- Paginated home page
- Support for featured post images (appears on cards in previews)
- Threaded comments with Disqus
- Google Analytics integration

## Installation instructions

(Instructions are based off of those for the [Polymer Starter Kit](https://github.com/PolymerElements/polymer-starter-kit).)

- Clone this repository or download it as a .zip file and unzip.
- Install jekyll (and any other Ruby gems) with `bundle install`. (Prerequisite: must have Ruby installed. You may also have to install bundler with `gem install bundler`.)
- From the project root folder, run `npm install -g gulp bower && npm install && bower install`. (See the [Polymer Starter Kit installation instructions](https://github.com/PolymerElements/polymer-starter-kit#install-dependencies) for more details or troubleshooting.)

## Structure

- `app/`: All Jekyll content is here. (This is where all the editing happens)
  - `bower_components`: Content installed via bower ends up here
  - `elements/`: Custom web components using Polymer
  - `images/`: User images
  - 'media/': Other user content (PDFs, videos, etc.) for final product
  - `scripts/`: Javascript files
  - `styles/`: Custom CSS
- `dist/`: Built output from Gulp. (Use to publish static content)
- `node_modules`: Content installed via npm goes here

## Deployment

### Serve/watch

`gulp serve`: Starts a jekyll serve process on the default port (4000 or whatever is specified in `_config.yml`).

`gulp serve --port 6666`: Start serving on port `6666`

`gulp serve:dist`: Build as below, and serve the result from the `dist/` directory. (Useful for testing changes to the gulpfile.)

### Build and vulcanize

`gulp`: Builds the files with jekyll, vulcanizes, minimizes, and puts the result in the `dist/` directory. (This can be slow.)

## Deploy

`gulp deploy-gh-pages`: Deploy the current build to the gh-pages branch of your repository.

`gulp build-deploy-gh-pages`: Rebuild and then deploy. (Equivalent to `gulp && gulp deploy-gh-pages`)

## Future Improvements:

- Improve gulp build
    - Minimize JS, CSS, HTML
- Search
    - Ripple effect in search results on click (needs set height)
    - Escape toggles search show
    - arrow keys/tab moves focus on search results
    - better animation for search bar leaving/entering
- Navigation drawer
    - Change hover effect on drawer items (see Google Music)
    - Make selected/active items in drawer colored
- Page transition animations
- Give option of setting card-colorbar color
- Add ripple effect to nav drawer menu items
- Pagination:
    - Maybe replace with actual buttons
    - hover effects like buttons?
    - Handle if it gets too wide for screen? (limit number of page links)
- Tags
    - Show tags with posts
    - Allow filtering by tag
- Add material box or lightbox for images
- Add 'source' option for YAML frontmatter
- increase spacing between list items
- Fix things like header-panel to utilize updates to polymer paper elements

### Known issues

- JS and HTML aren't minimized
- Too much space on cards between end of excerpt and read more button
